The easiest way to install HoloPy is to use the conda-forge build. See the
documentation for more information
(https://holopy.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial/install.html)

If you want to build HoloPy yourself, here are some instructions.

Dependencies
------------

To gather all the dependencies needed to build HoloPy, the simplest approach is
to use the included environment.yml file to make a new conda environment

  conda env create -f ./environment.yml

Then activate the new environment:

  conda activate holopy-devel

For Windows, if you don't already have Fortran and C compilers installed, you
can edit the environment file to install m2w64-toolchain.

Then you have two options for building and installing the package on your
system.

Installation
------------

If you want to install the binary build of holopy on your system, cd to the root
of the repository and run

pip install .

This will build the package and scattering extensions (using meson) and install
HoloPy in your current environment, so that python will automatically be able to
find it when you type "import holopy".

Editable install
----------------

For developers, it's convenient to be able to make changes to the code and have
those changes immediately available to unit tests or scripts. To enable this
functionality, you can do an editable install. From the root of the repository,
run

python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .

This will build the package and scattering extensions, and install a stub in
your current environment that loads the package from the build directory. If you
change the code and re-import holopy, it will be automatically rebuilt by meson.
